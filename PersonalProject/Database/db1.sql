The story is rather extraordinary in that the normal problems faced by young lovers are here so very large. It is not simply that the families of Romeo and Juliet disapprove of the lover\'s affection for each other; rather, the Montagues and the Capulets are on opposite sides in a blood feud and are trying to kill each other on the streets of Verona. Every time a member of one of the two families dies in the fight, his relatives demand the blood of his killer. Because of the feud, if Romeo is discovered with Juliet by her family, he will be killed. Once Romeo is banished, the only way that Juliet can avoid being married to someone else is to take a potion that apparently kills her, so that she is burried with the bodies of her slain relatives. In this violent, death-filled world, the movement of the story from love at first sight to the union of the lovers in death seems almost inevitable.\nWhat is so striking about this play is that despite its extraordinary setting (one perhaps reflecting Elizabethan attitudes about hot-blooded Italians), it has become the quintessential story of young love. Because most young lovers feel that they have to overcome giant obstacles in order to be together, because they feel that they would rather die than be kept apart, and especially because the language Shakespeare gives his young lovers is so exquisite, allowing them to say to each other just what we would all say to a lover if we only knew how, it is easy to respond to this play as if it were about all young lovers rather than about a particular couple in a very unusual world. (When the play was rewritten in the eighteen century as The History and Fall of Caius Marius, the violent setting became that of a particularly discordant period in classical Rome; when Leonard Berstein rewrote the play as West Side Story, he chose the violent world of New York street gangs.)'),(44,'9780062024039','images/books/Divergent.jpg','Divergent',20,'Young Adult','Katherine Tegen Books',2011,'In Beatrice Prior\'s dystopian Chicago world, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue—Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent).

Then, under some pressure from some POTterHEAD peers of mine, I tried the newest blend called the Goblet...and everything changed.'),(2,7,2,'Greetings, loved ones, and let us talk of a young witch named Hermione Granger. Hermione is, and always has been, a delight to read. Not necessarily because she\'s a girl, but because she is the only character amongst those 14 year olds who actually has a good head on her shoulders.'),(15,8,3,'This is my favorite installment of the quintessential modern bildungsroman. Nevertheless, it has its problems, familiar to any reader of Rowling\'s.'),(11,8,1,'hrrmmpp. This is my least favourite of the Harry Potter series, and almost borders on the don\'t bother.'),(5,8,5,'Harry\'s outburst to his friends at No. 12 Grimmauld Place. A combination of frustration over being kept in the dark and fear that he will be expelled fuels much of Harry\'s anger, and it all comes out at once, directly aimed at Ron and Hermione. Rowling perfectly portrays Harry\'s frustration at being too old to shirk responsibility, but too young to be accepted as part of the fight that he knows is coming.'),(8,9,1,'Well I decided to come back and actually put in a review for this book since all I\'d done is give it a star and go on my merry little way.'),(10,9,5,'The crown jewel of the Harry Potter series, Half-Blood Prince is one of the finest novels I\'ve read in my lifetime. Having allowed us to watch Harry evolve and mature for so many years, Rowling finally lifts the veil, so to speak, humanizing the larger than life characters of not just Dumbledore and Snape, but significantly and achingly, Tom Riddle.'),(15,10,5,'Most seventeen-year olds don’t view the possibility of an early death as being, well, possible. But then again, most seventeen-year olds haven’t come face-to-face with death almost half a dozen times before their first kiss either.'),(19,10,5,'t was September 1998; the third Harry Potter book had just been released. Pottermania? What\'s that? It was still unknown except to a vast population of younglings who\'d read it... and I fell in love.'),(17,11,4,'3 1/2 stars. I completely get why many HP fans will be disappointed with this, but I have to admit: I really enjoyed it. I\'d love to see this story play out on stage.'),(5,11,4,'I know I gave this 4 stars, but to be honest, J.K. Rowling can write a dictionary with Harry Potter illustrations and I\'d probably give it 4 stars, so my rating is almost irrelevant here, given my extreme bias.'),(2,12,5,'I read this book a long time ago, when I was ten years old. I remembered nothing from it except thinking it was really, really good. And here I am, thirteen years later. I picked it up again because I was curious about what my reaction would be to it now.'),(12,12,5,'OK, everyone needs to stop what they\'re doing and go find a copy of Sissy Spacek reading this book. I am not exaggerating when I say it is the best audiobook performance I have ever heard.'),(9,13,3,'Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen started off annoying me and ended up enchanting me. Up until about page one hundred I found this book vexing, frivolous and down right tedious. I now count myself as a convert to the Austen cult.'),(6,14,1,'I really enjoy lively details. There\'s nothing better than knowing an author has really thought about her characters and situations, and come up with some surprising and delightful detail that makes the whole reading experience fuller.'),(12,14,1,'Let me give you an idea of how much my opinion of this book changed at different stages of reading. When I was about a third of the way through, I was so into it that I immediately put my name on the library reservations list for the sequel, and wishlisted every edition on BookMooch. Now, having finished, I doubt I\'ll bother to read any further in the series.'),(4,14,5,'Oh my. This book, to me, is like chocolate: a delicious, sinful, addictive indulgence which you convince yourself has beneficial qualities (zinc, calcium, keeps me quiet at that time of the month...) in order to justify your addiction.'),(15,15,1,'Bella Swan\'s relationship with her hot vampire boyfriend Edward Cullen is heating up when her characteristic clumsiness messes everything up again at her vampire-thrown birthday party. In typical Bella style, she gives herself a paper cut and Edward has to literally throw himself in front of her to keep her from being dinner for six hungry vampires.'),(11,15,3,'I am totally insane. Even though I totally dissed Twilight in this blog, I have an obsession with series and read New Moon.'),(4,15,5,'I read this in 7 totally engrossing hours, staying up till 2am to finish it - hence I now feel a bit wrecked, both emotionally and physically. New Moon was absolutely heart-wrenching (you can tell I invest heavily in these books can\'t you?!).'),(3,16,1,'Agh. What is the point of any of this? Edward is so dull and controlling and creepy. I think even a seventeen-year-old would need more than unearthly beauty and a nice car to inspire this epic, world-ending love.'),(6,16,1,'I was very disappointed in this book. I liked Twilight and enjoyed New Moon, but this installment felt like a dime romance novel to me. She didn\'t introduce any new characters and spent the whole book on the love triangle between Edward, Bella, and Jacob.'),(3,18,2,'Welcome to Narnia, where nobody has genitalia.'),(5,18,1,'I read this when I was little (I would guess about 7, 8 or 9), and I didn\'t pick up on all the Christianity references, despite them being SO overt. What I did feel was astonishment that the children all loved Aslan so much, when I thought he was massively sanctimonious and sickening as a character.'),(4,18,4,'I just re-read this book and got so much more out of it than the first time. The symbolism & parallels to basic Christianity stuck out.'),(9,18,5,'I loved this book. It was first read to me in 4th grade. We would all come in from lunch and our teacher would read to us for about 30 minutes before we would start class.'),(11,19,4,'I read this aloud to my older boy, age 6. It\'s a good book, and he enjoyed it, but didn\'t ring the bell in the same way Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe did. I think the biggest reason for this, was that it wasn\'t as accessible to him.'),(12,19,2,'Hamlet with badgers.'),(19,19,5,'November 19, 2008. I\'ve read these books a zillion and one times and surely I shall read them a zillion more. Because every single time, I realize new truths and find more honor in their pages.'),(6,20,3,'It feels odd to mark this book as anything less than five stars. It was a huge part of my childhood.'),(12,20,5,'I knew that the new film version of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader was going to be bad. I did not know that it was going to be that retarded that I\'d question my faith in my own taste.'),(15,20,3,'Having read the first book back in Christmas and feeling confused about the reading order I\'ll say that this was a very enjoyable and easy to read children\'s book.'),(8,21,4,'I\'m just going to give a generic opinion of the whole series. We love them. The end.'),(18,21,3,'The last two books are definitely not in line for my favourites. There are various factors -- one of which is simply that I don\'t like seeing Narnia come to an end!'),(7,21,4,'I felt that The Silver Chair gave better character arcs to the son and daughter of Adam and Eve than some of the other Narnia books. The focus of the book seemed to be shared between the children, Eustace and Jill, as well as the quest - instead of focusing on the quest alone.'),(9,22,5,'This is probably my favorite of the Chronicles. It takes place during the Golden Age of Narnia, with the Pevensies reigning in their prime, although the story is actually set in the countries to the south of Narnia, which provides for a rather different feel to much of this novel.'),(2,22,2,'I feel more conflicted about this book than any of the other Narnia books. On the plus side, the story is stronger and CS Lewis manages to keep his blatant editorializing to a minimum (maybe because none of the characters are transplants from wartime London).'),(15,23,5,'I thought this book was so beautiful. Favorite quotes/parts: He put on a very high, shiny, stiff collar of the sort that made you hold your chin up all the time. He put on a white waistcoat with a pattern on it and arranged his watch chain across the front . . . He took his eye-glass, with the thick black ribbon, and screwed it into his eye; then he looked at himself in the mirror.'),(3,23,3,'Despite the fact that The Magicians Nephew is the first book in the Chronicles of Narnia, strangely, it is frequently overlooked. People skip straight ahead to The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, and then, at a later date come back to this book.'),(16,23,4,'The Narnia books have always been some of my favourites. There\'s always been a magic in it for me, even now I\'m twenty -- I never got to the age where I was too old for fairytales. That, or I passed through it so quickly I\'m already out the other side.'),(12,24,5,'I just recently re-read this and the Horse and His Boy on the recommendation of a friend. I haven\'t read the Narnia books in a really long time, but had been wanting to, after reading some of CS Lewis\' theology writings, and figuring out that all of those lions and daughters of Eve were morality tales in disguise.'),(13,24,2,'I recently reread this series. I was very worried that my added perspective as a religious studies major and adult would mar my childhood love of the books, but honestly, this is the only one in the series that I found unpalatable.'),(6,24,5,'Lewis understands the way the world works better than any other writer I have ever read. It\'s likely due to his appreciation for story and powerful imagination fed by scripture.'),(8,25,5,'I give this 5 stars, BUT there is a disclaimer: If you want a fast read, this book is not for you. If you only like happy endings this book is not for you. If you don\'t like experimental fiction, this book is not for you.'),(19,25,5,'This is a book to treasure, a new classic. I absolutely loved it.'),(1,26,NULL,'Funnily enough, i read this book as a child and thought that it really WAS about animals. I remember thinking, Evil Pigs, I\'m glad you\'re bacon in MY world, and Poor Hardworking Horsies, come live on my farm instead. You can have all the hay and makopa you want (sadly, no apples, tropical climate).'),(6,4,5,NULL),(2,1,5,NULL),(1,7,5,NULL),(6,9,5,NULL),(1,10,5,NULL),(10,12,1,NULL),(5,13,5,NULL),(10,17,5,NULL),(11,17,5,NULL),(12,17,1,NULL),(5,22,4,NULL),(6,23,5,NULL),(15,24,1,NULL),(12,25,5,NULL);
